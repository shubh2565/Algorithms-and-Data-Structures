# Algorithms-and-Data-Structures

This repository contains codes for implementing various algorithms and data structures.
An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as output (Source: [Introduction to Algorithms](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition)).
In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)).

Most of the codes and problems in this repository are inspired from the below mentioned three books:
* Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other by Aditya Y. Bhargava
* Programming Pearls by Jon Bentley
* The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena

Following folders contain the implemented codes:
